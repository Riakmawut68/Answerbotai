   - Plan selection ‚Üí Payment initiation ‚Üí Success callback
   - Proper timeout management
   - Stage synchronization with subscription status

4. **Payment Timeout Flow** - ‚úÖ WORKING
   - 15-minute automatic timeout and recovery

   - User can type "status" to check progress
   - Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling** - ‚úÖ WORKING
   - Duplicate phone numbers handled correctly
   - Invalid phone format rejected properly
   - Payment without plan selection prevented
   - Stuck payment recovery automated

### **‚úÖ ALL FIXES VERIFIED**

1. **Stage Definition Standardization** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - User model enum updated with all needed stages
   - Removed duplicate 'subscribed' stage, using only 'subscription_active'
   - Migration script handles existing invalid stages
   - No more database validation errors

2. **Payment Timeout Handling** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - PaymentTimeoutService implemented and integrated
   - 15-minute timeout with automatic recovery
   - User commands ("cancel", "status") working
   - Scheduler running every 5 minutes for cleanup

3. **Payment Plan Fallback** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - No more dangerous default to 'weekly' plan
   - Explicit plan selection required before payment
   - Users prompted to select if no plan chosen

4. **Mobile Number Validation Consolidation** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Single validateMobileNumberForUser() function
   - Duplicate logic removed from multiple locations
   - Consistent behavior across all flows

5. **Subscription Stage Synchronization** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Payment success sets stage = 'subscription_active'
   - Stage accurately reflects subscription status

### **‚úÖ SYSTEM BEHAVIORS VERIFIED**

1. **Command Processing Order** - ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - General commands processed first by commandService
   - Stage-specific commands handled in stage logic
   - No conflicts between command types

2. **Message Limit Logic** - ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - Stage checks happen first (subscription_active limits)
   - Then plan-based limits applied
   - Trial vs subscription limits properly differentiated
