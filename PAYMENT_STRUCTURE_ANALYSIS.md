# Complete Payment Structure Analysis - Answer Bot AI

## Executive Summary

The Answer Bot AI messenger bot implements a sophisticated payment system with MTN MoMo integration, featuring environment-specific behavior, sandbox testing capabilities, and comprehensive user stage management. This analysis covers the complete payment flow, user stages, messages, and environment differences.

## 1. User Stages and State Management

### 1.1 Stage Definitions

The system uses 8 distinct user stages defined in the User model:

```javascript
enum: [
  'initial',                    // New user, no interaction
  'awaiting_phone',            // Waiting for trial phone number
  'awaiting_phone_for_payment', // Waiting for payment phone number
  'trial',                     // Active trial user
  'awaiting_payment',          // Payment initiated, waiting completion
  'subscribed',                // Active paid subscriber
  'payment_failed',            // Payment attempt failed
  'subscription_expired'       // Subscription ended
]
```

### 1.2 Stage Transitions

#### **Initial Flow:**
1. `initial` → `awaiting_phone` (after consent)
2. `awaiting_phone` → `trial` (valid new number)
3. `awaiting_phone` → subscription flow (used number)

#### **Payment Flow:**
1. `trial` → `awaiting_phone_for_payment` (subscription selected)
2. `awaiting_phone_for_payment` → `subscribed` (sandbox bypass)
3. `awaiting_phone_for_payment` → `awaiting_payment` (normal flow)
4. `awaiting_payment` → `subscribed` (successful payment)
5. `awaiting_payment` → `payment_failed` (failed payment)

#### **Lifecycle Management:**
1. `subscribed` → `subscription_expired` (auto-expiry check)
2. `subscription_expired` → `awaiting_phone_for_payment` (renewal)

## 2. Payment Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

```

### 2.2 Payment Flow Types

#### **Type 1: Sandbox Bypass (Development Only)**
- **Trigger:** Development environment + test phone numbers
- **Test Numbers:** `['0921234567', '0927654321']`
- **Process:** Real payment initiated → Auto-simulated success → Instant activation
- **Messages:** Success message only (no processing message)

#### **Type 2: Normal Payment Flow (All Environments)**
- **Trigger:** Production environment OR non-test numbers
- **Process:** Real payment initiated → User completes on phone → Webhook callback
- **Messages:** Processing message → Success/failure message

## 3. Environment-Specific Behavior

### 3.1 Development Environment

```javascript
// Config differences
NODE_ENV: 'development'
MOMO_ENVIRONMENT: 'sandbox'
sandbox.enableBypass: true
```

**Characteristics:**
- Sandbox bypass enabled for test numbers
- Payments use EUR currency (1 EUR = 3000 SSP, 2 EUR = 6500 SSP)
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- MTN sandbox API endpoints
- Test phone number: `256770000000` (hardcoded)

### 3.2 Production Environment

```javascript
// Config differences  
NODE_ENV: 'production'
MOMO_ENVIRONMENT: 'production'
sandbox.enableBypass: false
```

**Characteristics:**
- No sandbox bypass (all payments real)
- Payments use SSP currency (actual amounts)
- Production MTN MoMo API endpoints
- Real phone number validation required

### 3.3 Currency and Amount Mapping

| Environment | Display | Payment Currency | Weekly | Monthly |
|-------------|---------|------------------|--------|---------|
| Development | SSP     | EUR             | 1 EUR  | 2 EUR   |
| Production  | SSP     | SSP             | 3000   | 6500    |

## 5. Sandbox Bypass Deep Dive

### 5.1 Activation Conditions

```javascript
// All conditions must be true:
1. NODE_ENV === 'development'
2. config.sandbox.enableBypass === true
3. phoneNumber in ['0921234567', '0927654321']
```

### 5.2 Bypass Process Flow

```
1. User enters test phone number
2. SandboxBypassService.shouldBypassPayment() → true
3. MomoService initiates REAL payment to MTN sandbox
4. SandboxBypassService.simulatePaymentCallback() creates fake success
5. MomoService.handlePaymentCallback() processes fake callback
6. User subscription activated immediately
7. Success message sent directly (bypassing normal webhook)
8. User stage set to 'subscribed'
```

### 5.3 Bypass vs Normal Flow Comparison

| Aspect | Sandbox Bypass | Normal Flow |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Real Payment** | ✅ Yes (to sandbox) | ✅ Yes |
| **User Action Required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (phone prompt) |
| **Processing Message** | ❌ Skipped | ✅ Sent |
| **Success Message** | ✅ Immediate | ✅ After webhook |
| **Time to Activation** | < 1 second | 15 minutes max |
| **Testing Purpose** | ✅ Development only | ✅ All environments |

## 6. Configuration Analysis

### 6.1 Key Configuration Points

```javascript
// Environment Detection
config.app.environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'

// Sandbox Bypass Control  
config.sandbox = {
  enableBypass: envVars.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  testPhoneNumbers: ['0921234567', '0927654321'],
  adminNotification: true
}

// MTN MoMo Settings
config.momo = {
  environment: process.env.MOMO_ENVIRONMENT || 'sandbox',
  baseUrl: process.env.MOMO_BASE_URL || 'https://sandbox.momodeveloper.mtn.com',
  getPaymentCurrency: () => this.environment === 'sandbox' ? 'EUR' : 'SSP',
  getTestPhoneNumber: () => this.environment === 'sandbox' ? '256770000000' : null
}

// Usage Limits
config.limits = {
  trialMessagesPerDay: 3,
  subscriptionMessagesPerDay: 30
}
```

### 6.2 Production Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    env: node
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production  # Disables sandbox bypass
      - key: MOMO_ENVIRONMENT  
        value: production  # Real MTN MoMo API
```

## 7. Security and Validation

### 7.1 Phone Number Validation

```javascript
// MTN South Sudan Format: 092xxxxxxx (10 digits total)
/^092\d{7}$/.test(phoneNumber)
```

### 7.2 Payment Security

- **Webhook Verification:** SHA256 signature validation with FB_APP_SECRET
- **Reference Tracking:** Unique payment references prevent replay attacks  
- **User Validation:** Payment callbacks matched to specific users
- **Environment Isolation:** Sandbox/production environment separation

## 8. Logging and Monitoring

### 8.1 Comprehensive Logging Points

```javascript
// Payment Flow Logging
🔄 [INITIATING PAYMENT]     // Payment start
🚀 [PAYMENT INITIATED]      // MTN API success  
🔓 [SANDBOX BYPASS DETECTED] // Test number detected
⏳ [NORMAL PAYMENT FLOW]    // Real payment flow
📊 [PAYMENT FLOW SUMMARY]   // Complete flow summary

// Stage Transitions
✅ [PHONE REGISTERED]       // Valid phone accepted
💳 [PLAN SELECTED]          // Subscription chosen
🎉 [SUBSCRIPTION ACTIVATED] // Payment successful
```

### 8.2 Error Tracking

```javascript
❌ [PAYMENT INITIATION FAILED]
❌ [INVALID PHONE]  
❌ [TRIAL LIMIT REACHED]
❌ [AI RESPONSE ERROR]
```

## 9. Development vs Production Summary

|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Environment** | NODE_ENV=development | NODE_ENV=production |
| **MTN API** | Sandbox (EUR) | Production (SSP) |
| **Sandbox Bypass** | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled |
