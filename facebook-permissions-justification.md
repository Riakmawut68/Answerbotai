---

## Required Permissions & Justifications

### 1. **pages_messaging** (Required)
**Permission Level:** Standard  
**Justification:**
```
Our Answer Bot AI chatbot requires the pages_messaging permission to send and receive messages between users and our Facebook page. This is essential for our core functionality as an AI-powered educational assistant that helps users with academic questions, business guidance, agriculture advice, health information, and general knowledge queries.

The bot provides:
- AI-powered responses to user questions
- Educational content delivery
- Subscription management messages
- Payment processing notifications
- Trial period communications
- User onboarding and consent collection

Without this permission, users would not be able to interact with our AI assistant, which is the primary purpose of our application.
```

### 2. **pages_messaging_postbacks** (Required)
**Permission Level:** Standard  
**Justification:**
```
The pages_messaging_postbacks permission is essential for our bot's interactive features and user flow management. We use postbacks to handle:

- User consent collection ("I Agree" button clicks)
- Trial activation ("Start Free Trial" button)
- Subscription plan selection (Weekly/Monthly plans)
- Payment processing confirmations
- Menu navigation and user choices
- Command system interactions (/help, /status, /reset)

These postback interactions are crucial for our subscription-based business model and user onboarding process, allowing users to seamlessly navigate through our service tiers and payment options.
```

### 3. **pages_show_list** (Required)
**Permission Level:** Standard  
**Justification:**
```
We require pages_show_list permission to display our Facebook page information to users who interact with our bot. This permission allows us to:

- Show our page name "Answer Bot AI" in conversations
- Display our page profile picture and branding
- Provide users with context about who they're interacting with
- Build trust and credibility for our AI service
- Enable users to visit our page for additional information

This is particularly important for our subscription service as users need to know they're interacting with a legitimate, branded AI assistant service.
```

### 4. **pages_manage_metadata** (Optional - for advanced features)
**Permission Level:** Advanced  
**Justification:**
```
The pages_manage_metadata permission would allow us to programmatically update our page's messaging settings and webhook configurations. This is useful for:

- Automatically configuring webhook endpoints during deployment
- Updating page messaging settings based on user demand
- Managing multiple page configurations for different regions
- Implementing dynamic response times and availability settings
- Automated page management for scaling operations

While not essential for basic functionality, this permission would improve our operational efficiency and deployment automation.
```

### 5. **pages_read_engagement** (Optional - for analytics)
**Permission Level:** Standard  
**Justification:**
```
The pages_read_engagement permission would enable us to access basic engagement metrics for our page, which is valuable for:

- Understanding user interaction patterns
- Monitoring bot performance and usage
- Identifying peak usage times for capacity planning
- Tracking subscription conversion rates
- Measuring user satisfaction and engagement levels
- Optimizing our AI responses based on user behavior

This data helps us improve our service quality and make informed business decisions about our subscription tiers and features.
