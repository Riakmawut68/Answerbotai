## 💰 Currency and Amount Configuration

### Sandbox Environment (EUR)
- **Weekly Plan**: 1 EUR (displays as 3000 SSP)
- **Monthly Plan**: 2 EUR (displays as 6500 SSP)
- **Currency**: EUR (sandbox supported)

### Production Environment (SSP)
- **Weekly Plan**: 3000 SSP
- **Monthly Plan**: 6500 SSP
- **Currency**: SSP (production)

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. Payment Session Clearing Issue
**Problem**: The `paymentSession` field is not being cleared properly after successful payment
**Root Cause**: MongoDB schema definition issue with nested objects
**Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect functionality but leaves stale data
**Workaround**: Use `$unset` operator for clearing

### 2. API Verification Failure
**Problem**: Payment callback verification fails with fake references
**Root Cause**: Expected behavior in sandbox environment
**Impact**: Prevents testing of complete callback flow
**Solution**: Use real payment references for testing

### 3. Facebook Messenger Integration
**Problem**: Messenger service fails with test user IDs
**Root Cause**: Facebook requires valid user IDs
**Impact**: Prevents testing of user notifications
**Solution**: Use real Facebook user IDs for testing

## 🔧 Recommendations

### 1. Fix Payment Session Schema
```javascript
// Current schema
paymentSession: {
    planType: String,
    amount: Number,
    startTime: Date,
    status: String,
    reference: String,
    processedAt: Date
}

// Recommended fix
paymentSession: {
    type: {
        planType: String,
        amount: Number,
        startTime: Date,
        status: String,
        reference: String,
        processedAt: Date
    },
    default: null
}
```

### 2. Implement Proper Error Handling
- Handle API verification failures gracefully
- Implement fallback mechanisms for payment processing
- Add retry logic for failed operations

### 3. Use Real Test Data
- Use real Facebook user IDs for Messenger testing
- Use real payment references for callback testing
- Implement proper test data management

### 4. Payment Session Clearing
```javascript
// Use $unset operator for clearing
await User.updateOne(
    { messengerId: user.messengerId },
    { $unset: { paymentSession: "" } }
);
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary
